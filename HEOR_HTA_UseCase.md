Here are several key roles and specific examples of how HEOR (Health Economics and Outcomes Research) contributes to health technology assessment (HTA) and regulatory processes:

1. **Cost-Effectiveness Analysis**:
    - **Example**: When introducing a new drug, the HEOR team conducts cost-effectiveness analyses to compare the new drug's costs and benefits with existing treatments. For instance, the UK's NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) often uses such analyses to determine whether a new drug should be included in the NHS (National Health Service) reimbursement scheme.

2. **Budget Impact Analysis**:
    - **Example**: HEOR teams evaluate the potential financial impact of new drugs on healthcare budgets, helping decision-makers understand budget changes post-introduction. In the US, ICER (Institute for Clinical and Economic Review) frequently performs such analyses to provide guidance to insurance companies and healthcare plans.

3. **Calculation of Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALY)**:
    - **Example**: QALY is a metric that combines survival time and quality of life. HEOR teams use QALY to assess the value of new treatments. For instance, in cancer treatment, HEOR teams might calculate the QALYs for different treatment options to help patients and doctors make informed decisions.

4. **Patient Outcomes Research**:
    - **Example**: HEOR teams study the impact of drugs on patient quality of life, disease progression, and survival rates. These findings can be used to demonstrate the overall value of new drugs to regulatory agencies. For example, in chronic disease management, HEOR teams might collect and analyze patient-reported outcomes (PROs) to assess the treatment's impact on daily living.

5. **Market Access Strategy**:
    - **Example**: HEOR teams analyze market and economic data to help companies develop effective market access strategies. For example, in the European market, HEOR teams might evaluate the reimbursement policies and economic evaluation standards of different countries to develop pricing and market entry strategies.

6. **Policy Support**:
    - **Example**: HEOR research findings can provide scientific evidence to support the development and adjustment of healthcare policies. For example, public health agencies might use HEOR data to evaluate the economic feasibility and long-term effects of vaccination programs, thereby creating more effective vaccine policies.

These examples illustrate how HEOR plays a crucial role in HTA and regulatory processes, supporting the market entry of new drugs and providing scientific evidence for the efficient allocation of healthcare resources and improvement of patient outcomes.
